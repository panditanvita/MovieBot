now that the bot can ask questions and fill in a movie request, we want to move on the
next step: answering general questions

two parts:
-recognising that there is a question/understanding the question
-answering the question, which is a lot easier

other features:
-options for choosing numbered answers still needs to be done
-timeout for repeating the same question
aaannnnd options for choosing a different day (will need to scrape theatres for the
next day as well, and tie that into our knowledge base)
