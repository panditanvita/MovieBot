now that the bot can ask questions and fill in a movie request, we want to move on the
next step: answering general questions

two parts:
-recognising that there is a question/understanding the question
-answering the question, which is a lot easier

also, options for choosing numbered answers still needs to be done

aaannnnd options for choosing a different day (will need to scrape theatres for the
next day as well, and tie that into our knowledge base)

#todo

#what movies are playing at [theatre] (#time of day modifier)

#where is [movie] playing? (#time of day modifier)
